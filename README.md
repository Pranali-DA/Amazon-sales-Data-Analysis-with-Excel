This project involves analyzing Amazon sales data to explore trends, customer behavior, and patterns in product returns. Through this work, I'm aiming to provide insights that can help sellers optimize their offerings, address common issues, and improve customer satisfaction.

Project Overview
Problem Statement
As part of this project, I’m working with a dataset to help an Amazon seller understand their:

Sales Performance: Identifying which products and categories contribute the most to revenue.
Customer Behavior: Analyzing customer segments to see who brings in the most value.
Product Return Patterns: Investigating trends in returned products to help the seller make data-informed adjustments.
Objective
My goal is to perform a thorough analysis to extract actionable insights, visualized through a comprehensive Excel dashboard.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: For analysis, calculations, and building the dashboard.
And Google Sheets: Used for sharing and submitting my work.
Analysis Process & Insights
Here’s a breakdown of the main areas I focused on in this project:

Sales Distribution Across Product Categories

I analyzed how sales are spread across various categories, helping to highlight top contributors.
Top 5 Sub-Categories by Sales

Using a bar chart, I visualized the top 5 sub-categories, making it easier to spot which products perform best within each category.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I created KPIs for overall sales and profit and compared them to the previous year (2016).
I also developed regional sales KPIs across North, South, East, and West to see performance by location.
Customer Segmentation

My analysis of customer segments helps to understand which groups are most valuable, providing insights for targeted strategies.
Returned Product Analysis

I identified the top 10 products that are most frequently returned, which can be useful in addressing potential quality or listing issues.
Top Customers & Products

Top 10 Customers by Purchase Volume: I highlighted the most active customers based on purchase counts.
Top 10 Most Frequently Bought Items: Focusing on the popular items can help prioritize high-demand products.
Dashboard Overview
I’ve created an interactive Excel dashboard to display these findings, including:

Bar Charts for quick comparisons of top categories and sub-categories.
KPI Cards for quick insights into sales, profit, and regional distribution.
Return Analysis Chart for a visual summary of frequently returned products.
